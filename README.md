# 2022_MIP_280A4_final_project
This reposity contains the code and results from the final project for MIP 280A4, Microbial Sequence Analysis, a class taken at Colorado State University in Fall 2022 with Dr. Mark Stenglein. The goal of this project was to assemble the Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) of *Paenibacillus sp*, a pink-pigmented bacteria with novel antibiotic potential. The steps of this project are outlined in `report.md`, including sequencing, quality control, assembly, and analysis. The code used to accomplish this is found there. Furthermore, images of results (including quality statistics and genetic alignments) are in this file. Package information with versions can be found in `additional_information.md`.
